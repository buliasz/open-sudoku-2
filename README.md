# Merging back to the Open Sudoku code

As agreed with Óscar García Amor the author of the current Open Sudoku, I'm the new maintainer of that
code and will be moving the Open Sudoku 2 to Open Sudoku.
In practice it will be more like overwriting that code because practically all the java code was
rewritten in Kotlin, there were plenty of changes here and there and new functionalities.

You should expect that soon this project will be moved to [the original Open Sudoku repo](https://gitlab.com/opensudoku/opensudoku).
Instead of Open Sudoku 2, it will be back Open Sudoku with the new big version number (4.0).
This will probably take a week to make sure the update will not break backward compatibility so
that the current users of Open Sudoku will not loose their data by updating to the new version.

# Open Sudoku 2

[Open Sudoku 2](https://github.com/buliasz/open-sudoku-2) is an open-source Sudoku game based on the
Open Sudoku project. Open Sudoku 2 has been rewritten in the Kotlin programming
language with lots of improvements, fixes and reimplementation. It is up to date with the current
Android coding standards. New functionalities as well as improvements for the already existing ones
are there.

It's designed to be controlled both by finger and keyboard.
It's preloaded with 90 puzzles in 3 difficulty levels.
More puzzles can be downloaded from the web, and it also allows you to enter your own puzzles.

## Testing and updates

The application is currently in the testing stage on Google Play. To join testers and get automatic
updates please follow [this Open Sudoku 2 Google Group link](https://groups.google.com/g/opensudoku2/)
and click on the "Ask to join group" button. Once approved you'll get access and see the Play Store
link you can use for app installation and updates. The link is only accessible for the group members. 

The app binary is at the moment accessible only for testers until it passes Google testing requirements
(20 testers opted in for at least 14 days), but you can always build your own binary from the sources
available in this repository.
