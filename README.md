# Open Sudoku 2

[Open Sudoku 2](https://github.com/buliasz/open-sudoku-2) is an open-source Sudoku game based on the
Open Sudoku project. Open Sudoku 2 has been rewritten in the Kotlin programming
language with lots of improvements, fixes and reimplementation. It is up to date with the current
Android coding standards. New functionalities as well as improvements for the already existing ones
are there.

It's designed to be controlled both by finger and keyboard.
It's preloaded with 90 puzzles in 3 difficulty levels.
More puzzles can be downloaded from the web, and it also allows you to enter your own puzzles.
